# DAW2020-ExameRecurso

This repository contains the code for an university exam project, where the goal was to create a Node.js API and a Pug interface to manage a tournament and its players and scores.

## Node.js API
The API was developed using Node.js and it allows to perform CRUD operations on tournaments, players and scores. The API uses the Express framework and MongoDB as the database. Endpoints were implemented to create, read, update and delete tournaments, players and scores.

## Pug Interface
The Pug interface was created to provide a user-friendly way of interacting with the API. It allows to perform the same CRUD operations as the API, but in a visual way. The interface was created using the Pug templating engine and it communicates with the API using Axios for HTTP requests.
